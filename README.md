# reactreduxboilerplate

Clone repo. 
Run npm install. 
Run npm start to start webpack dev server.
Run npm run dev to build development ready /dist folder
Run npm run build to build production ready /dist folder

I've included: 
- sample code for a basic bootstrap grid system. Overwrite any bootstrap styling or write your own styles inside inside src/scss/styles.scss
- sample react components using a container/presentational structure. Think of containers as smart components and presentational as dumb components. 
- sample redux module and wrapper using the redux ducks pattern. 
- Hashing files in /dist for proper caching 
- postcss integration with nanocss, stylelint and autoprefixer
